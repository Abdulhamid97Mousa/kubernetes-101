Kubernetes 101 is a new educational video series by Jeff Geerling, and the first live episode will premiere on YouTube on November 18, 2020.

Jeff Geerling is the author of bestselling book [Ansible for DevOps](https://www.ansiblefordevops.com), and streamed a very popular [Ansible 101](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2020/ansible-101-jeff-geerling-youtube-streaming-series) series earlier this year on his YouTube channel. Jeff is also writing [Ansible for Kubernetes](https://www.ansibleforkubernetes.com), and has maintained a Raspberry Pi Kubernetes cluster for many years, the [Raspberry Pi Dramble](http://www.pidramble.com).

This series will cover all the basics of Kubernetes and cloud-native infrastructure, and will demonstrate how to manage containers, clusters, and applications running inside those clusters.

### Special thanks

Special thanks to the series sponsor, [Amazee.io](https://www.amazee.io). Amazee offers fully managed Kubernetes clusters, and they take away the stressful work of managing Kubernetes itself, so you can focus more on the software you run on your clusters. They also maintain [Lagoon](https://lagoon.readthedocs.io/en/v1.10.0/), which runs on Kubernetes and lets you deploy your applications automatically, enabling powerful and easy GitOps workflows.
